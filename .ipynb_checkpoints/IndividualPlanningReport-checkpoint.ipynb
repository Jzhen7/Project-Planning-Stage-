    "In the first graph, we are able to see how newsletter subscription rates vary across genders, but are limited by small sample sizes for some categories. Additionally, the data doesn't allow us to make any explicit conclusions yet, but does allow us to see how a majority of these groups are subscribed. The second plot shows us the relationship between experience level and subscription rates and allows us to observe that the proportions are quite similar, suggesting that experience might not be a strong predictor."

    "I propose to use Knn-classification since our response variable, subscribe, is categorical, not numerical.

    "Knn has three crucial assumptions: Similar observations are closer together and numerical values are scaled appropriately, each row represents an independent observation, and each class has sufficient representation. However, a limitation of Knn is if a class doesn't have sufficient representation, it can offset the model. Additionally, it is very dependent on the K value, which we will tune the number of neighbors (k) using cross-validation on the training set. For each k value, we will evaluate model performance using metrics such as Accuracy or Precision and recall. I also plan on splitting the data into 80% training and 20% testing. \n",
